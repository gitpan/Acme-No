this module just follows the typical

$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make && make test
$ su
# make install

routine.

though this module was written for 5.8, it will work
under 5.6 and lesser perls.  however, the test suite blows
up (dumps core and other nonsense) under older perls 
due to some festering bug/interaction
between Carp::croak, perl's do() and/or require()
mechanism and Filter::Util::Call.  (see 
http://use.perl.org/~geoff/journal/7107).  this is why
I don't run some tests for old versions of perl.

so, if you want to use it with older perls, go ahead
and try it - there are a few files generated in t/lib
that you can run from the command line to see how
Acme::No works.  I've actually had luck running them
from the command line (outside of Test::More) using
5.6, 5.6.1, and 5.005_03;
