NAME 

Acme::No - makes no() work the way I want it to

SYNOPSIS

 use 5.6;            # I use our(), so 5.6 is required
 no  6.0;            # but this was coded for perl 5, not perl 6
                     # and the perl 6 compat layer isn't really 5.6
                     # so my code breaks under 6.0

 use mod_perl 1.27;  # we need at least version 1.27
 no mod_perl 2.0;    # but mod_perl 2.0 is entirely different than 1.0
                     # so keep my cpan email to a minimum
                  

DESCRIPTION

ok, first the appropriate pod:

$ perldoc -f no 
  =item no Module VERSION LIST

  =item no Module VERSION

  =item no Module LIST

  =item no Module

  See the L</use> function, which C<no> is the opposite of.


now, one might think that, since 

 use mod_perl 1.27;

makes sure that mod_perl is at least version 1.27,

 no mod_perl 1.27;

should mean that 1.27 is too high - the manpage says use() and
no() are opposites, and that looks like opposite behavior to 
me.  however...

 $ perl -e 'use mod_perl 2.0'
 mod_perl version 2 required--this is only version 1.2701 at -e line 1.
 BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at -e line 1.

 $ perl -e 'no mod_perl 2.0'
 mod_perl version 2 required--this is only version 1.2701 at -e line 1.
 BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at -e line 1.

so, no() and use() do the exact same thing here - hmmm... looks like a 
bug in perl core...

enter Acme::No

Acme::No makes no() work the way I want it to.

  $ perl -MAcme::No -e'no v5.9.0; print "ok\n"'
  Perl v5.009 too high--version less than v5.009 required at -e line 0

  $ perl -MAcme::No -e'no v5.9.1; print "ok\n"'
  ok

  $ perl -MAcme::No -e'no mod_perl 1.27; print "ok\n"'
  mod_perl version 1.2701 too high--version less than 1.27 required at -e line 0

  $ perl -MAcme::No -e'no mod_perl 2.0; print "ok\n"'
  ok
